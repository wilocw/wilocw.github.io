# Biography

Wil Ward is a Research Associate in the Resources, Infrastructure Systems and Built Environments (RISE) group in the Department of Civil and Structural Engineering at the University of Sheffield. He is working on developing machine learning workflows for the efficient retrofit of residential buildings to increase energy efficiency. Previously, he worked in Physics, Statistics and Computer Science departments, researching physically-informed probabilistic machine learning techniques, in particular Gaussian processes, for solutions to non-linear dynamical problems. He studied his undergraduate degree to Masters level in Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Nottingham. He went on to study a PhD in Computer Science in a collaborative project with the British Geological Survey, funded by the BGS-University Funding Initiative.

He is also the founder and former network coordinator of the [Sheffield Machine Learning Research Network](https://sheffieldmlnet.github.io), involved in promoting community for researchers using machine learning in the University of Sheffield. The role involved organising events, tutorials and promoting machine learning in the university.
