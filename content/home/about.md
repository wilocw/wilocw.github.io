# Biography

Wil Ward is a Research Associate in the Machine Learning Group at the University of Sheffield, working on probabilistic machine learning, in particular Gaussian processes and state space models. Previously, he studied his undergraduate degree to Masters level in Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Nottingham. He went on to study a PhD in Computer Science in a collaborative project with the British Geological Survey, funded by the BGS-University Funding Initiative.

He is the network coordinator of the [Sheffield Machine Learning Research Network](https://sheffieldmlnet.github.io), involved in promoting community for researchers using machine learning in the University of Sheffield. This role involves organising events, tutorials and promoting machine learning in the university.
