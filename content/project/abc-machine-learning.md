The Active Building Centre Research Programme is researching and developing innovative tools and technologies that will ensure buildings of all scales contribute to a reduction in carbon emissions and a more sustainable built environment.

The research I am involved in is looking at scalable solutions to residential building retrofit, by learning features and properties from large scale multi-source datasets, including visual imaging, thermography and LiDAR.
