abstract = "This paper investigates the use of multifractal formalism for characterising 3D brain vasculature of 2 different mammalian species. Multifractal properties were found across all the 3D vascular models. Variations in the analysis results appear to correspond with vessel density ans morphology. The implication of the research is that multifractal analysis could potentially provide a useful tool for clinical assessment of diseases that are known to alter density and structure of brain microvasculature."
