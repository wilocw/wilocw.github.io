description: "The Active Building Centre Research Programme is researching and developing innovative tools and technologies that will ensure buildings of all scales contribute to a reduction in carbon emissions and a more sustainable built environment.

The research I was involved in was looking at scalable solutions to residential building retrofit, by learning features and properties from large scale multi-source datasets, including visual imaging, thermography and LiDAR."

outcomes: ["A modular framework utilising mobile sensing and machine learning to build digital shadows of residential buildings to estimate energy consumption.", "Publications in Environmental Research Letters and Buildings and Environment, alongside conference appearances at Sustainability in the Built Environment (SBE)"]
